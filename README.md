## ScienceCurriculumPlanner
This Over-the-Top Achievers github page. Greetings!
We are a group of developers that are designing and developing a website for, product owner, Steve James. The website is a curriculum planner for the faculty of science, which will allow undergraduate students to plan their courses and modules for any of their years of study while verifying course availability and credit values. 
The website is balanced between front-end and back end. We will be creating a user-friendly interface that is well integrated with a fully functional back-end database. The front and back-end will have equal priority as it will need to work together for the website to function. We will be using the current curriculum planner available on ‘wits self-service‘ as inspiration. 
We will be using a three-tier architecture pattern: 
1.	Presentation tier: User interface – translates tasks and results to something the user can understand. Our website will be viewed on a web browser.
2.	Logic tier: Performs calculations, makes logical decisions and evaluation. Moves and processes data between presentation and data tier. This will be handled by NodeJS.
3.	Data tier: Stores information and retrieves it from databases. This will be handled by MongoDB.

# Getting started
  To begin with the repo you must first clone it with
  
  ``` 
  git clone https://github.com/Over-the-Top-Achievers/ScienceCurriculumPlanner.git
  ```
  To begin using the planner run 
  
  ```bash 
  node mongoCaller.js
  ```
  or on windows
  ```bash 
  node_modules\.bin\nodemon mongoCaller.js
  ```
  on linux 
  ```bash 
  ./node_modules/.bin/nodemon mongoCaller.js
  ```
  
  *note the project is still under heavy construction and this will likely change in the future*
  
 ### Dependancies 
  The project currently assumes you have a recent version of nodejs with npm installed.
  The rest of the dependancies are already in the repo.

### testing 
i am just testing my git functions

i am updating this again

and again
